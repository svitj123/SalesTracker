I want you to generate a complete production-ready web application with the following specifications. Do not simplify anything. Build the full system.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Build a full-stack web application that allows me to paste weekly agent sales reports in a text box, parses the report, stores it in a database, and generates sales statistics.
Reports look like this:

Brezovica
Obiskani: 13
Odzvani: 6
Fix: 2
Mob: 3
VS: 1
TW: 1
Ure: 4,5
(Žitko, Ožegović)

Notes:
- Only Fix and Mob count as sales.
- Other fields are used for analytics.
- Last line in parentheses contains customer last names, separated by commas.
- Decimal numbers may use comma or dot.
- Some fields (VS, TW) may be missing.
- Location is always the first line.
- I will paste multiple reports every week.

TECH STACK
Backend:
- Python FastAPI
- Endpoints must include:
  - /parse-report
  - /save-report
  - /get-reports
  - /get-stats
  - /get-monthly-sales
  - /delete-report/{id}

Frontend:
- Streamlit (hosted separately)
- Features:
  - Textarea to paste a report
  - Button: “Add report”
  - Table of all saved reports
  - Monthly sales dashboard
  - Graphs (Fix + Mob totals, conversion rate, hours worked, etc.)

Database:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Table: reports
  - id (uuid)
  - timestamp (created_at)
  - lokacija
  - obiskani
  - odzvani
  - fix
  - mob
  - vs
  - tw
  - ure
  - priimki (text array)
  - raw_text (complete pasted report)

Use SQLAlchemy models.

REPORT PARSER LOGIC
Create a Python parser that:
- Extracts values after keywords:
  - Obiskani
  - Odzvani
  - Fix
  - Mob
  - VS
  - TW
  - Ure
- Accepts both comma and dot decimals
- Converts commas → dots
- Extracts last names from parentheses in last line:
  - (Žitko, Ožegović) → ["Žitko", "Ožegović"]
- Returns structured JSON:

{
  "lokacija": "Brezovica",
  "obiskani": 13,
  "odzvani": 6,
  "fix": 2,
  "mob": 3,
  "vs": 1,
  "tw": 1,
  "ure": 4.5,
  "priimki": ["Žitko", "Ožegović"]
}

Backend must save:
- parsed JSON
- raw text

STATS API REQUIREMENTS
/get-stats must return:
- total Fix
- total Mob
- total sales this month (Fix + Mob)
- average conversion (Odzvani / Obiskani)
- total hours
- ranking of locations by sales
- all priimki grouped by day/week

/get-monthly-sales:
- Return grouped daily and weekly totals.

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (STREAMLIT)
Create pages:

Home
- Text area: "Paste weekly report"
- Button: "Add report"
- Display parsed preview before saving
- On success → "Report added"

Reports Table
- Table with all reports from the database
- Button to delete report

Dashboard
- Sales for month: Fix, Mob, Total
- Conversion rates
- Graphs:
  - Daily Fix + Mob
  - Weekly totals
  - Hours worked
  - Locations ranked

Customers
- List of all priimki (names)
- Grouped by date and location

Use Plotly for all graphs.

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
Generate:
- README.md with deployment steps:
  - How to deploy backend on Render (Free Tier)
  - How to deploy Streamlit front-end on Vercel or Streamlit Cloud
  - How to connect to Supabase
  - Environment variables required

Include .env.example with:

SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_KEY=

PROJECT STRUCTURE
Use this structure:

/
backend/
    main.py
    models.py
    database.py
    parser.py
    routers/
        reports.py
frontend/
    streamlit_app.py
README.md

DELIVERABLES
Replit must output a complete working project, including:
- Fully functional FastAPI backend
- Fully functional Streamlit frontend
- Fully functional report parser
- Complete REST API
- Supabase schema SQL
- All Python code
- All requirements.txt files
- Deployment instructions
- Example reports for testing

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT leave placeholders, except for required environment secrets which must be documented in .env.example.
- Do NOT oversimplify any part.
- Everything must be production grade.
- All endpoints must be fully implemented.
- Parser must handle missing fields safely.
